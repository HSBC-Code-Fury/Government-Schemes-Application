We have attempted to provide you an easy and single point access to information about several welfare schemes of the Government and their various aspects including eligible beneficiaries, types of benefits, scheme details etc. 

Citizens can browse for schemes from different sectors and apply according to their interest but approval is based on eligibility criteria. 

Once approved the payment will be directly credited to their account.
