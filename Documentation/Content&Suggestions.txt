  For ex. DateOfBirth should be Date of Birth, userName should be Username. 
3. Colour asthetics are Dark. Light colours should be used.
4. Bank Details are not taken from the Citizen. (atleast bank account number should be taken) 
5. If possible, display the list of all schemes directly o the citizen home page and instead of all schemes button 
   on the left, create my approved applications button where schemes with their status will be displayed, and replace my schemes with my applied schemes.
